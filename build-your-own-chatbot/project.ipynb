      "- Joseph Bondy, Esq. v. Donald J. Trump and others, in which a legal team representing Lev Parnas, a close associate of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, is seeking documents related to the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n",

It is also possible that the question is referring to a hypothetical future case that has not yet been filed. In this case, the judge presiding over the trial would not be known until the case is officially filed and assigned to a specific judge.\n",
