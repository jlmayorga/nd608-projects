    "For this project, I chose a dataset comprised of four Wikipedia articles focused on various legal issues involving Donald Trump. \n",
    "\n",
    "These articles include details on his prosecutions in New York, indictments, the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit, and the Stormy Daniels scandal. This selection is appropriate for this task because the content of these articles was not included in the training data of the GPT-3.5 model used in this project, which has a knowledge cutoff in September 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "By embedding and integrating these articles into our project, we can enable the language model to understand and generate information based on the latest and specific data that it originally would not have. This approach ensures that the model can provide accurate and up-to-date answers about these topics, despite their absence in its initial training dataset. \n",

    "Using these targeted embeddings allows us to bridge the knowledge gap effectively, demonstrating a practical application of embeddings in enhancing the model's performance on newer information."

      "\n",
      "- Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.\n",
      "- The investigation by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) into potential campaign finance violations related to hush money payments made to women who allegedly had affairs with Trump.\n",
      "- The New York Attorney General investigation into the Trump Organization's financial dealings and potential tax fraud.\n",
      "- The defamation lawsuit filed by writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s.\n",
      "- Various lawsuits filed by state attorneys general related to Trump's policies and actions as president, such as the travel ban and separation of families at the US-Mexico border.\n",
      "- Impeachment proceedings in 2019 and 2021 for abuse of power and inciting insurrection, respectively. Trump was impeached twice but ultimately acquitted by the Senate.\n",
